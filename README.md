Smart contracts practiced from different sources

## MyToken.sol
This is a Solidity smart contract for a token called "GlobalOffensive" (abbreviated "GO"). It has a total supply of 100 and three functions: "addUser", "mint", and "burn" for managing the token supply and user balances. It also has a "transfer" function for users to transfer tokens.

## Challenge.sol
This is a Solidity smart contract called "Challenge" that contains four functions: "add", "sub", "mul", and "div". These functions take in two uint parameters and perform arithmetic operations on them. Each function returns the result of the operation performed.

## FunctionTutroial.sol,IfElse.sol, variable.sol
Theses are practice smart contracts to check how functions, loops nad variables works in solidity.
